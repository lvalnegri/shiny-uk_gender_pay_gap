## UK Gender Pay Gap

In 2017, the UK government introduced the [Gender pay reporting]() legislation that makes it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees across the whole organisation. Some employer (mostly Civil Service) has decided to publish its findings even if it had less than 250 staff on payroll, as part of an initiative to improve transparency.

Every employer must publish the following figures:
  - mean and median gender pay gap in hourly pay
  - mean and median bonus gender pay gap
  - proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment
  - proportion of males and females in each pay *quartile*, meaning when divided into four equal groups ordered from lowest to highest pay.
